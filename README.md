# AIDemise

A simple AI-based survival scenario game built with FastAPI for the backend and Svelte for the frontend. This project was developed to explore FastAPI (having mostly used Flask before) and to learn the basics of Svelte.

## Features

- AI-generated scenarios via `gen_scenario` in `AI.py`
- AI-generated story outcomes via `gen_story_result`
- FastAPI server defined in `main.py`
- Svelte client in `sveltey/src`

## Getting Started

1. Run `start.bat` to launch the FastAPI server and the Svelte dev server in separate terminals.
2. Open your browser at the address the Svelte dev server prints (default: `http://localhost:5173`).
3. Enjoy the AI-driven survival scenarios!

## Road Map

- Add a multi-player mode
