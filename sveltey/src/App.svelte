  <p class="Saneriao"> The building around you is engulfed in flames, smoke filling the air as the heat intensifies. You must act fast to survive. Your goal is to find a way out before the fire consumes everything. You can search for a fire extinguisher to control the flames or try to find an emergency exit. There may be hidden routes or tools, like a flashlight or water, to help you navigate the smoke and obstacles. But time is running outâ€”the fire spreads quickly, and the building could collapse at any moment.<br><br>What will you do?</p>
